I have created this application to learn the developement and working of `Serverless React web application`. In order to make the Serverless App I have used `AWS` services like `Amplify`, `DynamoDB`, `Lambda` & `API Gateway`.

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install` - To install all the dependencies

`npm start` - Runs the app in the development mode.
